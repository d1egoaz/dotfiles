# The signingkey value is your GPG key ID (the lower 64 bits of the fingerprint)
# which is derived from your public key and does not carry any secret information.
# Therefore you can publish it to the same extent you would publish your public
# key. (Instead of the shorter key ID, you could also use the full fingerprint for
# the signingkey value.)
